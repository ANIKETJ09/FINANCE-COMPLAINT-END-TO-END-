### Task 1

Feature engineering code is implement in [feature_engineering.py](../census_consumer_complaint/ml/transform/feature_engineering.py)

```
def preprocessing_fn(inputs):
    outputs={}

    return outputs
```
Task need to be done

If you carefully observe that for each feature we have use same technique to convert categorican feature to numerical now you have understand EDA file attached in notebook folder and update transfomation code for each columns

### Task 2

ANN model architecture is designed in [trainer.py](../census_consumer_complaint/ml/model/trainer.py) try to change the model network retrain your model


### Task 3
Data is synced with s3 as per existing airflow setup use gcp storage to sync data to s3
